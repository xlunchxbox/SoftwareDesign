Assignment 2: Due 11:59PM October 11

Use Test First Development to create a console application that will let us
monitor the net asset value.

The program will read a file which contains a number of stock symbols and the
number of shares held in each.

It will then go out to Yahoo finance to fetch the latest stock price value for
each of the ticker symbols given. The URL for this service is 

http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=SYMBOL

Once it finds the ticker symbol, the net asset value for that symbol is the
price * number of shares.

After computing the value, the program will print out in a tabular form,
in descending order of worth, the following details:

SYMBOL		price		number of shares	  worth
...				...			...									...
...				...			...									...
...				...			...									...
...				...			...									...
...				...			...									...
...				...			...									...
...				...			...									...

Total: The total worth
